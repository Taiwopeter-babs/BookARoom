# BookARoom - A robust room booking API application

The idea behind BookARoom is to help accomodation-seeking users book rooms easily. An enterprise that seeks to use this API will be able to:

- Add new rooms for users to book
- Update amenities of each room
- Provide an interface for a user to book a room or multiple rooms, set booking date and departure date
